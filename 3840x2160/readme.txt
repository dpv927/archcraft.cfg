| Theme for 3840x2160 resolution | <- @dpv927
----------------------------------

In this directory, you can find a script to install the theme on your system (install.sh),
along with files that have been specifically created for this resolution.

Both the configurations for polybar, rofi, and alacritty have been modified to ensure they
appear with the highest quality and at the correct font size and dimension.

Note: Some widgets that came with polybar by default have been removed, such as mpd 
(music player) and the system battery (the latter because I use a desktop PC).

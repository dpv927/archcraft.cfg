Both the configurations for polybar, rofi, and alacritty have been modified to ensure they
appear with the highest quality and at the correct font size and dimension.

Note: Some widgets that came with polybar by default have been removed, such as mpd 
(music player) and the system battery (the latter because I use a desktop PC).
